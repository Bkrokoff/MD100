# UNDERSTANDING TCP/IP

192.168.100.1

Each section is called an octet
- Worth 8 binary bits

TCP/IP is a 32 bit addressing system

Class A: 1-126
Subnet mask: 255.0.0.0 (16.7 million addresses)

Class B: 128-191
Subnet Mask: 255.255.0.0 (65k)

Class C: 192-223
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0 (254)

Class D: 224-239 <-- Multicast

Class E: 240-255 <-- Experiment

Subnet mask breaks the IP aaddress into two sections
- Subnet is your network ID while the 0 portion of a subnet mask is your unique hosts identifier
