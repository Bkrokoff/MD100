# UNDERSTANDING NAT AND PROXY SERVERS 

Network Address Translation (NAT) - A routing protocol that allows routers to separate your internal network from the internet

Private IP Ranges
10.x.x.x
172.16.x.x
192.168.x.x

Everybody can use these private Ip ranges on their network

You can get a ton of computers out to the internet while only having one public IP address

You can use a proxy server with NAT

Proxy Servers can do the following:
- Firewall
- VPN
- NAT
- Router
- Web Caching - It will cache a previousy visited website so the next time you connect to it, it will load faster
- URL Control - Polices where people can go on the internet and which sites they can access
