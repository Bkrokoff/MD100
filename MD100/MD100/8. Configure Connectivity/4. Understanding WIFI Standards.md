# UNDERSTANDING WIFI STANDARDS

Wifi Standards
- 802.11a - 54 mb/s (Could not get far from WAP)
- 802.11b - 11 mb/s (Could go further than 802.11a)
- 802.11g - 54 mb/s (Could go as far as 802.11b and be as fast as 802.11a)
- 802.11n - 300 mb/s (Dual bonding)
- 802.11ac - 1 GB/s (5 GHz)

Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP)
- Uses Rivest Cipher 4 (RC4) which is weak
- Uses a 24-bit weak Initialization Vector (IV)

Wifi Protected Access Version 1 (WPAv1)
- Uses Rivest Cipher 4 (RC4) which is weak
- Uses a temporal key integrity protocol (TKIP) for a 48-bit IV

Wifi Protected Access Version 2 (WPAv2)
- Uses Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) which is strong
- Uses Cipher Chaining Mode Protocol (CCMP) for a 48-bit IV

Two modes of Authentication for WPA

Personal Mode
- Pre-Shared Key (PSK)
	- For small business or homes
	- Essential just a passord that gets shared with people you want to allow on your Wifi

Enterprise Mode
- 802.1x Authentication
	- For higher environments that need a higher level of security
	- Each user can use passwords, certificates, smartcards, or biometrics for authentication
	- Requires a RADIUS server or similar
