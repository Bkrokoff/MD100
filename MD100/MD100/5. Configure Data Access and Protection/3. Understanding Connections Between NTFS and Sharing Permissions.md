# UNDERSTANDING CONNECTIONS BETWEEN NTFS AND SHARING PERMISSIONS

NFTS + NFTS = cumulative
Share + Share = cumulative
NTFS + Share = Most Restrictive

![[connections1.png]]

When NTFS permissions and Share permissions have a conflict, the most restrictive permissions will apply

![[connections2.png]]

In this example John has Modify permissions from NTFS and full control permissions from Share

NTFS + Share = Most Restrictive
Modify + Full Control = Modify

The two below will only happen if the user is connecting over the network to the resource:
Share + Share = cumulative
NTFS + Share = Most Restrictive

If John was accessing the files on the lcoal computer, only the NTFS permissions matter

Generally want NTFS permissions to be more restrictive than share

You can see the specific permissions for a user:
Go to advanced tab in security > Then go to effective access tab > Type in their name and view effective access
- You can see all of their permissions there
