# UNDERSTANDING AND CONFIGURING NFTS PERMISSIONS

Principle of least privilege when setting permissions
- Giving someone the least amount of rights thay need in order to complete their job

NTFS Permissions - File system we use in windows environment

NTFS permissions are manages in the security tab in the access control list

If permissions are greyed out, it signifies that they are inherited permissions
- Permissions inherited from the folder above

Full control - you can do anything you want (gerneally only given to admins)

Modify - Can do anything full control can do except change permissions, take ownership, and deleting subfolders

Read & Execute - They can read and execute files in the folder

List folder contents - They can see the files in the folder, but not read them

Write - Allows them to make changes

If you are in two groups and one group is denied permissions while the other one is given permissions you will be assigned the denied permissions

Permissions are cumulative, if you are member of two groups with different permissions you get both
