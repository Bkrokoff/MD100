# CONFIGURING DISK QUOTAS TO CONSERVE DISK SPACE

What if we need a way to control how much disk space a user can use

Go to the properties of their C drive and click the quota tab

Show quota settings
After you enable quota management you can limit the disk space to anything you need to

Quota won't stop them goving voer unless you set the Deny Disk Space to Users Exceeding Quota Limit option

You can use a cmd prompt for setting quotas as well
