# FOUNDATION OF THE MICROSOFT CLOUD

The concept of cloud computing is that you are hosting something as a service on the internet

Microsoft's main cloud technology is called Azure

IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) 
The most flexible category of cloud services 
Aims to provide you with complete control over the hardware that runs your application

You can host virtual machine's on their cloud

We can put all of our internal network on their cloud service (They use AzureAD as a their active directory service)

I only have to pay for what I use

PaaS (Platform as a Service)
Provides an environment for buying, building, testing, deploying, and running software applications
It does not include applications, it only gives you the platform that they can run on
(Office online, exchange online, sharepoint online, skype/teams, intune(MDM/MAM), Security as a Service, Autopilot, OneDrive)

SaaS (Software as a Service)
Software that is centrally hosted and managed for the end customer
Usually based on an architecture where one version of the application is used for all customers
Includes applications

IaaS    /    PaaS & SaaS
Azure /   Microsoft 365

ADDS = Active Directory Domain Services

You can connect your on-premise AD to Azure AD and synchronize them together

Azure AD Connect - Server that allows you to syncrhonize your on premise AD user accounts and passwords to the cloud (Can be apart of domain controller, but recommended to be separate server)

Hybrid Solution - Linking your on premise AD with the cloud

IAAS - Paying for the CPU usage and memory usage
SAAS and PAAS - Paying a subscription fee to use the Microsoft 365 products

Clouds main benefit is elasticity and paying for exactly what you need
