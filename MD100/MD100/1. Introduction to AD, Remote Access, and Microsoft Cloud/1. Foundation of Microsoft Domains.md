# FOUNDATION OF MICROSOFT DOMAINS

Originally had a peer-to-peer network

Microsoft invented domains to help with **centralization** for a group of computers

Microsoft invented a server called a domain controller, which helped manage multiple computers on a network

DC - Domain Controller
AD - Active Directory (where your user accounts, passwords, groups, etc. live)
GPO - Group Policy Objects (Allow us to deploy restirctions and settings out to all these machines)
FW - Firewall
Cloud - The internet
1000 Computers  

You'll want to have more than one domain controller
- For redundancy (fault tolerance) and load balancing

Domain controllers replicate 
- Anything you do to one domain controller carries over to the other one
- Synchronizes through active directory replication

Naming system used for managing everything is based upon DNS (Domain name server)

DNS helps manage everyones IP addresses inside its DNS database (Like an address book with phone numbers)
- Database is called a name space database or a zone database

All these computers are gonna boot up and register with DNS (Dynamic DNS)

Now, what happens is every one of these machines, your client computers, your servers, they all have to locate DNS by their IP settings and they're gonna ask DNS who the DC servers are so that they can all authenticate.

When computers boot up they will ask the DNS:
- "Who are my domain controllers"
- DNS will respond with a service record - pointing the client to the DC

Authentication system AD uses is based on a protocol called Kerberos

Security and querying language is built off of two protocols
- LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) - Query language
- Kerberos - Security authentication language
