# A FOUNDATION FOR REMOTE ACCESS, DMZs, AND VIRTUALIZATION

![[foundationAD.png]]

Occasionally, someone from the outside world may need to access the network

So we would setup something called a RAS (Remote Access Service) server
- RAS supports VPN (Virtual Private Network)

What if your company wanted to host a web server and make that available to people anonymously?
- We don't want to put the web server on our internal network, because then attackers might be able to find a way to access sensitive information (Pivoting - Hacker gains control of web svr and then pivots to other servers)
- We also don't want to host the web-svr outside our network because then we cannot protect it
- We get around this by purchasing a second firewall, thuse creating a DMZ (Demilitarized zone)

The two firewalls would be configured differently so people from the internet could still access the web svr, but not get in through the firewall protecting the internal network

We also may have internal servers that do different jobs
- Exch - Exchange server for handling emails
- SQL - For managing databases
- SPT - Sharepoint - Allows us to setup different types of sites that employees can use for things
- S4B - Skype

Virtualization was brought into mainstream by VMware and allowed companies to take advantage of something called elasticity

VMware found a way for us to take one server with tons of CPU power, RAM, and storage and setup all of our servers on that one physical server
- Called a Hyper-V

These are virtual machines running guest operating systems

What if one of these big servers go down?
- We can used something called **clustering** where we create a duplicate Hyper-V server and connect them together
- Now if one server fails, we have another one

Elasticity - involves the ability for your virtual machines to be able to request more resources when other virtual machines aren't using them.
- So, for example, let's say the exchange server is using 20 gigs of RAM, 
- Then the SQL server needs 30 gigs of RAM and the exchange server currently is not needing all that extra ram.
- The Exchange server can release that memory that it's not using.
- The SQL server can then take advantage of the released memory.
- Then when the SQL server is no longer using that memory, it can release it and allow the exchange server to use it.
