# USER ACCOUNT CONTROL (UAC)

UAC - Allows us to better control security for our users

UAC treates everyone like a normal user, until a user may need admin priviliges and then the UAC would give you the ability to escalate up to admin privileges if you need to

Its that little button that allows you to run apps as an admin
If you are not an admin it will prompt for a username and password
If you are an admin, it will just have a yes/no prompt

UAC cannot be bypassed by any type of software

Trusted Applications show up with a blue ribbon
If it was not a trusted application it would be yellow and add a warning message

There are several levels to UAC

You can use GPOs to manage UAC settings
