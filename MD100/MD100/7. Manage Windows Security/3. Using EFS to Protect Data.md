# USING EFS TO PROTECT DATA

EFS (Encrypting File System) - Allows me to encrypt individual files 

Need to use the NFTS partition in order to encrypt your files

Go to properties of a document
Click adavance Tab
Toggle encrypt contents to secure data

OK, so you got to understand that getting access to data, if you using encryption, there's two doors,
- Permissions door - You got an encryption for the permissions door, lets you get through the permissions.
- The encryption is another door that a person would have to pass through in order to get access to this file.

The details tab will allow you to add another user to the file so that they can access it

EFS can only encrypt one file at a time
If you want to do more you are going to need to use bitlocker
