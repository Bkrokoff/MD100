# ENABLING BITLOCKER DRIVE ENCRYPTION

Bitlocker will allow you to encrypt entire drives

Control panel > Bitlocker Drive Encryption

TPM (trusted platform module) - a special chip that's going to allow you to encrypt your hard drive.
- Its going to store encryption keys in it so that you can decrypt your drives

OS drives will require you to have a TPM chip while other drives without the OS on it can be used with bitlocker

You can configure a GPO that will allow you to enable bitlocker without a TPM

Computer Configuration > Policies > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Bitlocker drive encryption > Operating System Drives > Require Additional Authentication at Startup

Failsafe if you lost your mathaematical key for decryption
- Recovery Key
