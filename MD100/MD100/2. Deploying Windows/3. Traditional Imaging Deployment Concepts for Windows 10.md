# TRADITIONAL IMAGING DEPLOYMENT CONCEPTS FOR WINDOWS 10

If you're going to do a lot of imaging you should set up an imaging server

WDS - Windows Deployment Services
PXE - Pre-boot execution environment
WADK - Windows assessment and deployment tool kit
MDT - Microsoft Deployment Toolkit

Capture an image from our reference computer by booting into Windows PE

DISM will allow us to capture the image

Windows images is configured an offline image
Once the image is installed it is considered an online image

Offline image: sales.wim

You can have multiple images if you want inside an image server. Each one will be given an index number

You can then deploy the image from the server to the new computers with Windows PE and DISM

This is a lite touch installation

If you have a special server known as Endpoint Configuration Manager, we can do this as a zero touch installation

WoL - Wake on LAN - Can boot up the computers we need to install the image on

Endpoint Config Manager acts as an orchestrator and can do the entire process of capturing the image, and downloading them onto the machines without us touching it
