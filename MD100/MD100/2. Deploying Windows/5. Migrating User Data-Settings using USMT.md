# MIGRATING USER DATA/SETTINGS USING USMT

Side-by-side migration - Migrating user data from one computer over to another

Wipe/Load - Keeping the exisiting computer you have and upgrading to a new OS

USMT is a command line tool, not a graphical one

- Make sure you have downloaded the adk
- Open Deployment and Imaging Tools Environment as an administrator
- Run the following commands
	- > cd ..
	- > dir
	- cd "User State Migration Tool"

If you type:
- > dir
- In the new directory you will see amd64, arm64, and x86. 
- Since we are using a 64-bit processor we will do:
- > cd amd64

The files that we care about in this directory are exe files
- > dir \*.exe

These are our options

Scan state - Backup user information
Load state - Restore user information

Scan state syntax:
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/deployment/usmt/usmt-scanstate-syntax

> scanstate \\\\location\\you\\want\\to\\back\\up\\to

> scanstate c:\\backup

/i - includes xml files

Three main xml files:
- MigApp.xml = Application settings
- MigDocs.xml = Doc settings and locations
- MigUser.xml = User settings
- Config.xml = Allows you to exclude items
	- /genconfig 

/o = will overwrite any files you already have in the backup folder
/vsc (volume shadow copy) = Allows you to backup any data that is currently in use
/efs:skip = skips any encrypted files

Full command for a scanstate backup execution:

> scanstate c:\\backup /i:MigApp.xml /i:MigDocs.xml /i:MigUser.xml /o /vsc /efs:skip

This will backup all user profiles on the machine

What if you wanted to specify a specific user? (User Include)
/ui:<DomainName>\<UserName>
or
/ui:<ComputerName>\<LocalUserName>

Load State Syntax:
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/deployment/usmt/usmt-loadstate-syntax

Load state is done on the destination computer 

If you are using load state as a local account instead of a domain account make sure you include:
- /lac:[Password]
- /lae

Lae makes it an enbaled account. If you do not use this a disabled account would be created
