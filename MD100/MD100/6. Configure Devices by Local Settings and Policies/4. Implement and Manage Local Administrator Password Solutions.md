# IMPLEMENT AND MANAGE LOCAL ADMINSITRATOR PASSWORD SOLUTIONS (LAPS)

What if you need to reset the local admin password for a large group of computers?

Download LAPS on your DC

Make sure your user account applying LAPS changes is apart of the Schema Admins Group

Open powerhsell as an admin

> import-module AdmPwd.PS

>Update-AdmPwdADSchema

Set the OU that you want to make changes to with LAPS
>Set-AdmPwdComputerSelfPermissions -OrgUnit Worksations

Create a LAPS admin group so that people apart of this group can see the passwords that are set as the local admin password for each machine

>Set-AdmPwdReadPasswordPermission -Identity Worksations -AllowedPrincipals "LAPSAdmins"
- This gives people apart of the LAPS admins group the ability to see the passwords for computers apart of the Workstations OU

Now we can use a GPO to deploy the LAPS agent software out to all the workstations

- Group Policy Management > Group Policy Objects > Right-click and create a new GPO
- Edit the GPO
- Computer Configuration > Software Settings > Software Installations > New Package > Find the LAPS msi package and select it
- Now go to Adminsitrative Templates and find LAPS folder
- Enable local admin password management
- Drag the GPO to the Workstations OU

When your deploying software it takes a full computer restart in order for the GPO settings to refresh

Laps UI will allow you to see password when you type in the computer name
