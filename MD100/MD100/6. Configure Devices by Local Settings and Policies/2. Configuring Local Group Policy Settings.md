Two sides to Group Policy:
- Computer Configuration - computer config side of this is going to apply settings related to the computer itself and how the computer interacts with windows.
	- Any policy turned on/off here will affect anyone that sits at this computer
- User Configuration - going to affect users and their user settings and could actually be applied to specific users if you wanted.
