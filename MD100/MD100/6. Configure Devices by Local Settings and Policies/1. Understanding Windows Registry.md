# UNDERSTANDING WINDOWS REGISTRY

The registry is a repository/database that Windows uses to store all of the different settings, parameters, properties, attributes, and various things that you can manipulate in Windows

Registry Editor 

HKAY_CLASSES-ROOT - Used for file types and file type settings
- How your computer knows what application to open a file in

HKEY_CURRENT_USER and HKEY_USERS - These folders map to each other

HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG and HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE - These folders map to each other

With the CURRENT FOLDERS, it is involving anything in the memory right now. When you make changes in settings it goes into RAM first, so that it can be written to the drive

So when you reboot your computer the data is taken from the CURRENT folders and copied over to the other ones

HKEY_CURRENT_USER - Their profile settings and current state
HKEY_USERS - Represents all the users on that computer, each is assigned a syn number

HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG - Software and system settings

There are some settings you have to change in the registry as there are no GUI options for changing them
