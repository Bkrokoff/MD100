# UNDERSTANDING WINDOWS 10 ACTIVATION

WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) - WMI is a repository that keeps track of all ID numbers for everything that is happening on your computer

Keeps track of the serial number, your processor, motherboard, all the different hardware components, etc. 

The serial numbers will then be registered to the product key

How can I tell if I'm activated?
- Type activation settings in the search bar

Retail License - Buying a license for personal use and applying it to a microsoft account you own
OEM License - What you get when you buy a new computer (OEM licenses cannot be moved)
Volume License - You can license computers on a large scale

[[Multiple Activation Key (MAK)|MAK]] = Multiple activation key
[[Key Management Service (KMS)|KMS]] = Key Management Services

KMS is a type of server that you can setup in your environment thats going to help you manage all of your activations

It does not have to be a dedicated server, you could put this information on a DNS server if you wanted to

25-5 rule:
- 25 Client OS's
- 5 Server OS's

In order to use KMS you must meet the 25-5 criteria
- You need at least these many machines

Clients will query DNS for the KMS and then they will get activated

KMS can be linked to AD as well

There are a few things we can do from command line
> slmgr /dli

This will display license information

slmgr /upk = Uninstall current product key
slmgr /dli = Display current license info
slmgr /ato = Activate license
slmgr /ipk = Replace/Change Product Key
slmgr /xpr = Show expiration date of license
slmgr /rearm = Reset the 90 day period a server has so that it won't shut down on you (You can use this 3 times)
