# POWERSHELL FOUNDATION

Powershell - powerful command line environment

Good for writing scripts
Good for connecting to other machines

Runs off a verb-noun foundation:
- Get
- Set
- New
- Remove
- Move

Then the verb would be followed by a dash then a noun.

For example:
- get-process
- get-service

If you press tab it will auto-fill

Some commands require additional parameters when you run them

For instance, what if we wanted to start a service that was not running?
- start-service
	- We will need to add the actual service we want to start as the parameter to this command otherwise it will not work
- Full command: > start-service -Name winrm

get-command will show you every command available to you in powershell

What if you wanted to only get commands with a specific word in them?
> get-command -Noun net*

This will show you every command that starts with the word net

A * basically means any character

get-command -Noun \*net\* -Verb reset

So you can find any command you need using this command and some key words

If you want more information on a command you can run:
> get-help Reset-NetIPHttpsConfiguration

You can replace the command with any command you want to know more about

It might be easier to look commands up in the knowledge base instead of looking through powershell
