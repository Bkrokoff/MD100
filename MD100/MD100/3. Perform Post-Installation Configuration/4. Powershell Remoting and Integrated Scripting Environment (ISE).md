# POWERSHELL REMOTING AND INTEGRATED SCRIPTING ENVIRONMENT (ISE)

We're going to test remoting into our server

First thing you want to do is ensure the winrm service is running on the server

You can make this happen by typing the following command in cmd
> winrm quickconfig

You can see the processes of the server through the client by typing:
> Get-Process -ComputerName ATL-DC1

Change the last part to whatever the computer name is

The following command will allow you to actually remote into the machine:
> Enter-PSSession -ComputerName ATL-DC1

Now you can run commands as though you were at that machine

ISE brings us into the scripting environment for powershell
- If we had to make a change to hundreds of computers it may be easier to write a powershell script and point it toward those computer, rather than going into each one individually

For example, lets try and look at the event log in windows through powerhsell ISE

> Get -EventLog -LogName Security -Newest 10

This will allow us to see the 10 most recent security events

\| - allows you to take the output from one command and input it into another command

> Get -EventLog -LogName Security -Newest 10 | Format-List | Out-File c:\\log.txt

This command will dump all the information into a txt file

Then you can save powershell scripts to be used later
