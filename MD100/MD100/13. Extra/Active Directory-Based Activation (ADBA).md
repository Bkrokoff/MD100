# ACTIVE DIRECTORY-BASED ACTIVATION (ADBA)

Active Directory-Based Activation (ADBA) enables enterprises to activate computers through a connection to their domain. Many companies have computers at offsite locations that use products that are registered to the company.

You might use ADBA if you only want to activate domain joined devices.

Previously these computers needed to either use a retail key or a Multiple Activation Key (MAK), or physically connect to the network in order to activate their products by using Key Management Services (KMS). ADBA provides a way to activate these products if the computers can join the companyâ€™s domain.
