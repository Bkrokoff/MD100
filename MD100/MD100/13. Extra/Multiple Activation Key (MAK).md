# MULTIPLE ACTIVATION KEY (MAC)

A Multiple Activation Key (MAK) activates systems on a one-time basis, using Microsoft's hosted activation services (which requires connection with a Microsoft activation server). Once computers are activated, no further communication with Microsoft is required.

We recommend customers use Key Management Service (KMS) to activate Multiple Activation Keys (MAK). [[Key Management Service (KMS)|KMS]] is the preferred activation method for large scale deployments.

The main difference between KMS and MAK is that Key Management System (KMS) allows its users and organizations to activate the different services offered by the company within there their own network. While comparatively, on the other hand, the Multiple Activation Key (MAK) method uses the companyâ€™s hosting services and then activates the different services on a one-time basis.
