# CREATING GROUPS ON WINDOWS CLIENTS

What if a group of users need to access files on a file server?

You're going to go to an access control list on these fodlers and try to assign permissions to it

Put the 100 users in a group and then give that group permissions to access the folder

You can add a user to a group through the member of tab on the user properties or you can go to the group and add the user in the members tab

You can create security groups locally too through computer management
