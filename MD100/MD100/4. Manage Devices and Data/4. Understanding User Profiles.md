# UNDERSTANDING USER PROFILES

User state is kept inside a user profile

User profiles are known as local profiles

Deafult folder affects new users who log on

Each user who logs on has a special area of the registry
- NTUSER.DAT

If you rename the file to NTUSER.MAN, the user will not be allowed to make any changes

What if we wanted to make it so user settings would follow a user no matter what machine they logged in on?
- Roaming Profile

Go to AD on the DC 
- Go to User and find the profile tab under user properties
- Create a shared folder on a server and point her profile to that path
- Ex: \\\\server\\profiles\\%username%
